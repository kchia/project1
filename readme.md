# Instructions

-   Type the words on the ships to destroy them!
-   Gain 1 point per ship destroyed, if the ship makes it to the end where the player is lose a point.

# Objective

-   To help people improve typing skills.

### Technologies used

1. Phaser 3 for game engine.
2. HTML/CSS.
3. JavaScript.

### Unsolved issues

-   Ships animation stops after 1st time, when they are repopulated.
-   font colors can be better.
-   ship speed not ideal.
-   When a ship leaves the screen you can still finish typing the word.
-   Can be hard to tell which word your locked on.
-   Repeated code, could use refactoring. Not a full understanding of Phaser made it hard to create proper functions.
